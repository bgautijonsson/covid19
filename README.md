# Modeling

The hierarchical logistic growth model is estimated using `Make_Stan_NegBin_Model.R`, which sources scripts `Make_Stan_Data.R`, `Make_Landlaeknir_Data.R` and `Make_Pop_Data.R`. 

I wrote `Make_Past_Models.R` to perform historical validation on the Poisson mode but I have yet to update it for the Negative Binomial model.

# Dashboard

The University of Iceland dashboard has been moved to https://github.com/sindribaldur/dashboard_covid.hi.is, but I will keep the old version here.
